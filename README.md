# Highly composite number generator

After watching a [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM2oImb9Qg), I had some weird inspiration to try to make an algorithm to "efficiently" find highly composite numbers.

A say "efficiently" because I didn't want to use the assumptions about these numbers that I already know to influence the algorithmic design (that feels like cheating!), and because it's written in Python.

## Run it yourself

Run the Python file, then enter a max. I'd recommend not going above 25000 as you'll be waiting minutes between each value after this point.

```sh
python3 app.py
```
